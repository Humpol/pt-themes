All Themes have been verified to work on version (0.7.18) of Pterodactyl


Will this break my panel? (IMPORTANT)
After all the problems people faced with my older themes causing webserver 500 errors these themes no longer touch any fundamental panel files, they only change CSS files, the script also then re-applies all the basic permissions to the files it changes to stop any issues occuring. If you find a problem with my themes please tell me, moaning about it to other people wont help me! :)

Can I use them?
Sure! All of the themes you see below are made for you to take and change for your own personal projects! Or if you like them already you can keep them as they are!

Panel Versioning
Make sure that the theme you are installing corresponds with the version of the panel you are running; no help will be given if you have mismatched versions!

How do i use them?
Each Theme has a small code snippet that you must run inside the Pterodactyl panel directory, this is normally located at /var/www/html/pterodactyl/ The implementation command will take a backup of your current panel in case anything goes wrong during the theme change! So you don't need to worry about losing anything you've already made!

Suggestions
I'm sure there is something you would love to see changed, head over to the issues tab and i'll attempt on make it happen!
